#### Role: Research Assistant - Internship
  
Worked closely with Chami Group, a team led by Goylette Chami (MPhil PhD Associate Professor), to conduct in-depth research on Schistosomiasis and its impact in Uganda. The project included assessing the accessibility of health-carefacilities. R programming language was used to transform raw data into 6 insightful visualisations, including geospatial maps highlighting the locations of health centers and drug stores. Applied geospatial data to develop 4 insightful chloropleth maps, showcasing population density and the accessibility of health centers. Presented findings to 8 fellow researchers. Successfully managed tasks and deadlines, actively participated in progress meetings to ensure effective communication and collaboration.

To conduct my analysis I utilised data provided by Chami group & by sourcing data from the Ministry of Health - Republic of Uganda.

â€¢ Examined healthcare facility availability for the Ugandan population ,focusing on 3 municipalities: Mayuge, Buliisa,and Pakwach.

â€¢ Explored healthcare preferences, uncovering that across surveyed areas, 64% of establishments were drug stores, while 36% were health facilities.

â€¢ Wrote a comprehensive report discussing the epidemiology of the disease and quantified findings, contributing to the broader understanding of healthcare dynamics in the region.
